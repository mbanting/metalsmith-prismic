<h1 class="test-h1-class">Fruit Expert</h1>
<p>Here at Les Bonnes Choses, we acknowledge that it's a talent to know how to turn fresh material by nature, such as fruit, into something that plays well with the other pastry ingredients. Fruit are natural and temperamental, so you need to know exactly how to tame them and convice them to behave as per your will.</p>


And here are all the Macarons you can eat when you join our company:

<ul>
    <li><h1 class="test-h1-class">Cool Coconut Macaron</h1>
        <p>If you ever met coconut taste on its bad day, you surely know that coconut, coming from bad-tempered islands, can be rough sometimes. That is why we like to soften it with a touch of caramel taste in its ganache. The result is the perfect encounter between the finest palm fruit and the most tasty of sugarcane's offspring.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h1 class="test-h1-class">Salted Caramel Macaron</h1>
        <p>It's no wonder why our "Salted Caramel French Macaron" has become our best-selling macaron: on top of the authentic Parisian preparation that has been making our macarons so popular and enjoyed by gourmets, you can also feel the waves of Britanny's ocean as you bite into it. Two of the best French local gastronomies meet in your mouth, and suddenly, it's like French Revolution all over again, contained in a single macaron.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h1 class="test-h1-class">Speculoos Macaron</h1>
        <p>Did you know that World War I warriors on the French-Belgian frontier called an unauthorized truce in December 1914, so they could celebrate Christmas together? That's because in every situation, there's much joy to create and receive, from the natural friendship between the French and the Belgian cultures! So when Belgian speculoos meets French macarons, you get to experience the natural chemistry of cultures that are meant to work perfectly together...</p>
    </li>
    <li><h1 class="test-h1-class">Black &amp; White Macaron</h1>
        <p>If you feel like antique, experimented tastes are the way to go, then this macaron is perfect for you! A solid touch of dark chocolate, enveloped by a softening touch of vanilla, will take the best of both familiar world, to carry you to a brand new experience! Because you know <em>Les Bonnes Choses</em> always finds out just how to renew your classics for you...</p>
    </li>
    <li><h1 class="test-h1-class">Pistachio Macaron</h1>
        <p>If you are a <em>nut-cuisine-savvy gourmet</em>, you probably noticed that industrial pistachio flavour tastes very different than actual pistachio. </p><p>And yet, <strong>pistachio nuts shelter a pure, delicate taste, that needs preserving as much as possible</strong>, until it lands in your hands. Therefore, as you bite into our pistachio macaron, you will feel the pistachio nut bits not only delicately set on top of the macaron, but also inside the ganache itself.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h1 class="test-h1-class">Dark Chocolate Macaron</h1>
        <p>There is so much rich, decadent chocolate in this <strong>macaron</strong> that the chocolatey pleasure is just endless! </p><p>As you let the softness and the strength of our preciously selected cocoa waken your senses, you will feel a lot of pleasure and a little bit of guilt, for giving in to your dark (chocolate) side again!</p><p>There's no mistery why our Dark Chocolate Macaron is our longest-running pastry, in our whole collection, since our creation in 1992.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h1 class="test-h1-class">Vanilla Macaron</h1>
        <p>Experience the ultimate vanilla experience. Our vanilla Macarons are made with our very own (in-house) <strong>pure extract of Madagascar vanilla</strong>, and subtly dusted with <strong>our own vanilla sugar</strong> (which we make from real vanilla beans).</p>
